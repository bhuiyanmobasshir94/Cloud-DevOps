### Documentation for easy Django + Apache Deployment Configuration

After doing an excellent project we often float in big thoughts on how to do the deployment and where. As a noob, this kills our time a lot. That's why I wanted to find a way how I can deploy any Django project easily.

I have used Amazon EC2 instance - `t2.micro, p2.xlarge and g3s.xlarge` with `ubuntu 16.04` distribution of the Linux operating system. But you can do the same to any cloud with a Linux operating system.

To setup, Apache follows this URL. This is a well-written blog from Digital Ocean.

To install environment dependent (within python virtual environment)mod-wsgi do the following within your activated environment setup:
```
sudo apt-get install apache2-dev
pip install mod-wsgi
```
Get the environment variable from this command and set it to the apache config file `(/etc/apache2/apache2.conf)` ( paste it at the last):
```
mod_wsgi-express module-config
```
Check the apache config test and if it says syntax ok then you are good to go:
```
sudo apache2ctl configtest
```
Now we have to set several permissions for different folders including project folder, media folder, static folder and also for default database `DB.sqlite3` (if you are using it).
The project directory that holds `manage.py` file have to give permissions and also change ownership :
```
sudo chmod 775 <project_folder_name>
sudo chown :www-data <project_folder_name>
```
Database SQLite has to do the same (if you use this in production):
```
sudo chown ubuntu:www-data db.sqlite3 
sudo chmod g+w db.sqlite3
```
For serving media and static files in production, it is a good practice that we serve it from `/var/www`. This is preferred and said way. So we have to make a directory there.
```
mkdir <project_folder_name>
```
To configure the project directory that holds media and static:
```
sudo chown www-data:www-data -R <project_folder_name>
cd <project_folder_name>
```
Create media and static folder in the directory using the same mkdir command.
To change ownership and give permissions have to do the following to `static/media` folders:
```
sudo chown ubuntu:www-data -R media 
sudo chmod g+w media 
sudo chown ubuntu:www-data -R static
sudo chmod g+w static
```
To configure the default configuration file at `/etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf` (past it at the last before <virtualhost>):
  
    Alias /static/ /var/www/<project_folder_name>/static/
     <Directory /var/www/<project_folder_name>/static>
     Require all granted
     </Directory>
    Alias /media/ /var/www/<project_folder_name>/media/
     <Directory /var/www/<project_folder_name>/media>
     Require all granted
     </Directory>
    <Directory <path_to_django_project_folder_app_name>>
     <Files wsgi.py>
     Require all granted
     </Files>
     </Directory>
    WSGIDaemonProcess <arbitrary_name> python-home=<path_to_virtual_env> python-path=<path_to_django_project_directory>
     WSGIProcessGroup <arbitrary_name>
     WSGIScriptAlias / /<path_to_>wsgi.py

Make sure that the file has these permission set in `/var/www` directory:
```
drwxr-xr-x => <project_directory>
drwxrwx--- => media
drwxrwx--- => static
-rw-rw-r-- => <file_in_media_and_static>
```
And to do that we have to do the following:
To know which user you are logged on to:
```
$ whoami
>> ubuntu
```
And adding to your solution, if you are using an AWS Instance, you should add your user to the group to be able to access that folder:
```
Making a group for webservices users (varwwwusers)
$ sudo groupadd varwwwusers
Change the www folder and make it belong to varwwwusers
$ sudo chgrp -R varwwwusers /var/www/
www-data is the server making Django requests, add that to the group
$ sudo adduser www-data varwwwusers
Change folder policy
$ sudo chmod -R 770 /var/www/
Add ubuntu to the group of varwwwusers
$ sudo usermod -a -G varwwwusers ubuntu
$ sudo usermod -a -G varwwwusers www-data
OR
sudo groupadd varwwwusers
sudo adduser www-data varwwwusers
sudo chgrp -R varwwwusers /var/www/
sudo chmod -R 760 /var/www/
```
To restart Apache server:
```
sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart
```
You are now good to go.
To see the access log as you see in Django development server console:
```
sudo tail -f /var/log/apache2/access.log
```
To see the error log if any error happens in the server end:
```
sudo tail -f /var/log/apache2/error.log
```
Hope this helped you to get some basic ideas. I tried to keep it short and concise so that your workload can be minimized.
Thank you for your read.
